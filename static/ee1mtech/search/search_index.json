Is that allowed? It is allowed. The extra courses will be considered electives. I am an MTech RA. How many courses can I take in a semester? MTech RAs can take a maximum of three courses in a semester. The communications skills courses and the seminar are not included in this count of three. I want to take a course from outside the EE1 specialization and include it as one of the six electives. Is that allowed? You can do this for at most one such course, subject to faculty advisor approval. Where can I find the list of institute electives? The list is available at the academics homepage ( http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/circular.jsp ). When can I take the institute elective? Students typically take it after the first year. But you can take it anytime. Can I take more than one institute elective? Yes. I am an MTech RA. Can I take more than the required ten courses over the course of my MTech program? MTech RAs can take a maximum of three courses per semester. As long as this constraint is satisfied, you can take as many courses as you want over the course of your program.
