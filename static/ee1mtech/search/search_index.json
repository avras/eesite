Is that allowed? It is allowed. The extra courses will be considered electives. I am an MTech RA. How many courses can I take in a semester? MTech RAs can take a maximum of three courses in a semester. The communications skills courses and the seminar are not included in this count of three. I want to take a course from outside the EE1 specialization and include it as one of the six electives. Is that allowed? You can do this for at most one such course, subject to faculty advisor approval. Where can I find the list of institute electives? The list is available at the academics homepage ( http://www.iitb.ac.in/newacadhome/circular.jsp ). When can I take the institute elective? Students typically take it after the first year. But you can take it anytime. Can I take more than one institute elective? Yes. I am an MTech RA. Can I take more than the required ten courses over the course of my MTech program? MTech RAs can take a maximum of three courses per semester. As long as this constraint is satisfied, you can take as many courses as you want over the course of your program.

In this seminar, various existing coding schemes and deep learning methods has to be reviewed. Comparisons in terms of computation and performance will be used to further develop efficient learning decoders. Sibi Raj B Pillai Polar codes for decentralized high speed wireless links 1 student, Polar codes are finding increased applications in 5G and other high speed communication systems. This seminar involves reading about Polar codes, and implementing them for a multiple access system with two users. Sibi Raj B Pillai Low power wireless networks 1 student, This seminar is on the design an implementation of LoRa wireless technology on software radio. Nikhil Karamchandani Sequential estimation/inference algorithms for learning tasks such as clustering, ranking etc. Nikhil Karamchandani Coding for distributed optimization / storage Nikhil Karamchandani Modeling and analysis of content caching and delivery networks Prasanna Chaporkar Implementation and optimization of non-3GPP access to 5G core Vikram M Gadre Current challenges and innovations in radar signal processing This topic is to be pursued in collaboration with my current PhD students working at LRDE. It would be more appropriate for a person from DRDO or defence sponsored background but others are also welcome, if genuinely interested. Normally to be continued to the Dissertation. Vikram M Gadre Modern techniques and challenges in biometrics The aim here is to explore the tools and techniques underlying biometric signal and image processing, from the point of view of principles and applications in security, authentication and so on. Normally to be continued to the Dissertation.
